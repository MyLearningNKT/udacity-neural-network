## Welcome
Welcome to this course on Neural Networks. This course will provide a strong foundation in fundamental AI topics and skills: deep learning, neural networks and PyTorch.

The course is divided into four topic areas and you will learn how to:

### Introduction to Neural Networks
Identify the key components of a perceptron and describe how perceptrons form the building blocks of neural networks.
Implement a simple perceptron algorithm in code to determine a linear boundary between two classes.
Perform the key calculations required to apply the mean-squared error to gradient descent.
Implement MSE-based gradient descent in Python.
Perform the matrix multiplications needed for multilayer perceptrons.
Implement backpropagation using matrix multiplication in NumPy.

### Implementing Gradient Descent
